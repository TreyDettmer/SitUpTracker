## Getting Started
### Running The Application
Clone this repository. Using the command prompt, navigate to the repository's directory. Once inside the directory type **python main.py** to run the application.
### Using The Application
When the application is ran, you should see your webcam's live feed appear on the screen. If not, check here. On the right hand side of the screen type in how many sit-ups that you plan to do. When finished typing, click the "Done" button. 

Set your webcam view so that you can lay down and do a complete situp with your head and knees in the frame. Make sure that your knees are on the right side of the screen. You can mirror the video by pressing the "Mirror Video" button.
